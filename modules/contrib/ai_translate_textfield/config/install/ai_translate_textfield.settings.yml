  value: '<p>The automatic translation is created by a third-party LLM tool meaning that changes in tonality or even subject errors can occur. It should not be considered a final translation but rather a starting point to work off of. When using this feature, I understand that I must check the returned translation for mistakes, make improvements and ensure that the content matches the our desired tone of voice.</p>'
